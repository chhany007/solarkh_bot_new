## 🎯 Tips & Tricks

### 💡 Finding Your Monthly kWh

**Check your electricity bill:**
1. Look for "kWh" or "Units Consumed"
2. Find the monthly total
3. Use that number for quotes

**Example bill:**
```
Previous Reading: 1500 kWh
Current Reading:  2100 kWh
Monthly Usage:    600 kWh  ← Use this!
```

---

### 💡 Electricity Price

**How to find it:**
1. Check your bill for "Rate" or "Price per kWh"
2. Usually between $0.10 - $0.25 per kWh
3. In Cambodia: typically $0.15 - $0.20

**If you can't find it:**
```
Total Bill Amount ÷ Total kWh = Price per kWh

Example:
$108 ÷ 600 kWh = $0.18 per kWh
```

---

### 💡 Choosing System Size

**Rule of thumb:**

| Monthly Usage | System Size | Home Type |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| 200-400 kWh | 2-3 kW | Small apartment |
| 400-700 kWh | 4-6 kW | Medium home |
| 700-1500 kWh | 7-12 kW | Large home |
| 1500+ kWh | 12+ kW | Villa/Commercial |
